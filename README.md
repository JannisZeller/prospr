# ProsPr

This repo contains my attempt to implement ProsPr (neural network pruning) with <span style="color:#4bc9b0;font-family:'CaskaydiaCove NF', 'Cascadia Code', Consolas, monospace">tensorflow</span>. I mainly follow the maths described by [Alizadeh et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08132.pdf). I do neither have the resources nor the time to do benchmarks on the datasets and networks mentioned in the paper, instead I stick to the MNIST dataset and use a simple Dense-Network and LeNet-5 [LeCun et al. (1998)](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-01a.pdf) for classification. I reuse code from [GÃ©ron (2019)](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/).

In the [main notebook](./prune-mnist.ipynb) I show what problems occur when trying to implement the procedure from the paper with <span style="color:#4bc9b0;font-family:'CaskaydiaCove NF', 'Cascadia Code', Consolas, monospace">tensorflow</span>. Spoiler: There are some severe problems. In the [auxiliary notebook](./_aux.ipynb) there are some additional things I tried.
